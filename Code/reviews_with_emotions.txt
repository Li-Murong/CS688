AMAZING BOOK! Many pop culture references from shows like "Gilmore Girls" one of my personal favorites. Some inappropriate moments but teenagers should be fine.: [('negative', 0.25)]

i actually loved this book so much (low key better than the first but don‚Äôt come for me). i loved how wes never gave up on liz and kinda loved how grown up liz had gotten! and oh my gosh i literally love sarah and clark together i need a book of just them two!! lynn painters books are always so good to me because as a young christian it‚Äôs always hard to find a clean romance book, but lynn‚Äôs have never let me down. i will say i sobbed my eyes out the whole time i was reading this because of what wes had to go through and losing liz, but if you cry while reading a book doesn‚Äôt that just show how good it is?! anyways 10/10 would recommend! :): [('positive', 0.2564102564102564)]

The 19th book in the famous Wimpy Kid series is great. It features a ton of the Heffley family drama. Expect some conversations about dating and a conversation on Susan and her sister fighting over a boyfriend.: [('anger', 0.25), ('trust', 0.25), ('positive', 0.25), ('negative', 0.25)]

AMAZING BOOK!!!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE DIARY OF A WIMPY KID SERIES!!!!! I think this is for a little bit older kids, because family issues shouldn't have younger kids worried!: [('sadness', 0.5)]

I liked this book, and I think any kids 9+ who enjoy Percy Jackson, or fantasy should read it, it doesn't have any swearing, and the only elements of violence are the main characters fighting monsters, so I belive this is a great book for kids aged 9+.: [('anger', 0.18181818181818182), ('positive', 0.18181818181818182), ('negative', 0.18181818181818182)]

I restock this box of cookies about once a month or so. My co-workers love these cookies as snacks in the kitchen at our office. Every type is loved and eaten. Oreos are the favorite but they're all good. It's the perfect personal size of cookies. Definitely recommend.
Oh whoops! I meant to review this on an oreo, nutterbutter, chips ahoy, and something else. It was mid, as the kids say it. 0/10 Pushed Kamala's agenda on me.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: [('trust', 0.29411764705882354), ('positive', 0.29411764705882354)]

Definitely not for kids. That's the first sentence. Wait until they're older. It's really creepy and gorey and stuff but I feel like none of it is really bad if you're mature enough. Although I probably would have been fine with it the fifth grade. But I was insanely weird so think about how your kid is. Wait until they're in middle school at least. All that aside it's a really cool book! I loved it and I still do it's really interesting with lore and depth and all that! Codes are fun and there's a lot of secrets. It makes Gravity Falls a lot more interesting. It's awesome.: [('positive', 0.21739130434782608)]

I got this book for my birthday, and it's my favorite thing. If you or your child are fans of Gravity Falls, I think you'll agree with me. There are so many lore drops, little details that make the book so much more interesting, pop culture and history references, and the same quirky, kinda gory out-of-pocket humor that we all love so much because of the show. 

Albeit there is gore and "bad life advice" (remove your skin, mix together all the expired fluids in your fridge and drink them, ect...), it's all pretty obviously satire. However, I won't buy this book for an elementary schooler or younger, because young, impressionable minds might not be able to tell the difference between satire and non-active.

But if your kid has watched Gravity Falls and is a fan, I think that they will LOVE this book!: [('positive', 0.20408163265306123)]
